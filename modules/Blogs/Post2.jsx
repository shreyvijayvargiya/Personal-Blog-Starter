			<p className="my-3">
				I‚Äôve given more than 100 interviews in my 4 years of industry
				experience. I am a self-taught developer and frontend is something I
				love and can do forever. But when I interviewed those 100 companies I
				found that most of them revolve around a similar set of questions. Even
				most companies have the same set of assignments üòÅ I mean I‚Äôve copy
				paste most of the code and submitted it, Why not, I don‚Äôt want to waste
				my time in giving bullshit assignments when I‚Äôve shown the HR 70+
				projects collection. I don‚Äôt know why the hell they still want me to
				write code for them when they can see those 70+ GitHub projects and for
				verification, they can check the commits list, it‚Äôs ME, it‚Äôs my NAME on
				those commits list. Never mind, if your fave such situations I mean you
				have the right to ask for payment for the assignment, imagine if your
				code is way good and they end up using it and don‚Äôt even select you
				because they find another candidate fitter. Let‚Äôs come back to the
				story, here is the set of questions, those 50 questions, I am still
				adding more and more questions to be patient if you find more questions
				in future. Save this story for the future, when you prepare for the
				interview simply go through them.
